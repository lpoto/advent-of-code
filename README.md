## 2021

Trying to find shortest and most optimal solutions with python.

`python3 2021/main.py` to  run all days or `python3 20201/main.py i` to run day `i`

## 2020

Had fun with some C++

##

**NOTE** inputs should be in `year/inputs/` folder with name matching the day name (`2021/days/day01.py` --> `2021/inputs/day01.txt`)
